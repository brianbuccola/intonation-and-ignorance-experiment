    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

    <p>In this experiment, you will listen to several short dialogues between two speakers. After listening to each dialogue, you will be asked a question based on that dialogue.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>First, the dialogue will automatically play. There will be a play button on the screen that you can use to listen to the dialogue again as many times as you want.</p>

    <p>Beneath the sound file, there will be a question with two possible answers. You will have to choose between the two answers by clicking on the answer of your choice. Please make sure to listen to the entire dialogue before answering the question!</p>

    <p>Once you have chosen your answer, you can press any key to continue to the next dialogue.</p>

    <p>At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to answer a short questionnaire.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>Some of the dialogues are similar to each other. Please treat each dialogue as independent from all previous dialogues. (This is <em>not</em> one long conversation.)</p>

    <p>This experiment must be completed on a computer with a keyboard and a mouse, and with headphones (preferred) or speakers. Your browser must have JavaScript enabled in order for the audio to play.</p>

    <h2>Ready?</h2>

    <p>Please put on your headphones now or turn on your speakers. You will see two practice items to begin, so that you can make sure the audio player is working, adjust your volume, and familiarize yourself with the task.</p>

    <p>Thank you for participating!</p>
